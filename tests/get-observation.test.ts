/**
 * Tests for `get_observation` — the bounded read-by-id (D21).
 *
 * The gap: observation ids are handed out by `remember`, `recall` and `export`,
 * and both tools that ACCEPT an id destroy rows (`forget` deletes; `merge`
 * deletes every source and keeps only the caller's text). There was no
 * id-taking read, so a caller holding a destruction key could not see what it
 * addressed without `recall` — which is unbounded in practice, ranks badly at
 * `limit: 1`, and is itself a WRITE.
 *
 * Every bound below carries a positive control: an assertion that the fixture
 * WOULD have blown the bound under the alternative it replaces. A guard test
 * without one passes while proving nothing, which this repo has now had four
 * times (see CLAUDE.md and the D11 control tests).
