# Hippocampus — Universal Memory for AI

## One-liner

Your AI shouldn't forget who you are just because you switched apps.

*Docs: this file = what-it-is + the bet + non-priorities; `ROADMAP.md` = what's next; `DECISIONS.md` = go-forward decisions; `CLAUDE.md` = the how-it's-built design decisions + gotchas.*

## What It Is

An open-source, self-hosted MCP memory server. One server, every AI platform.

You deploy it once. Connect it to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Perplexity — anything that speaks MCP. Tell one AI about a project decision, and every other AI already knows.

## Why It Matters

Every AI platform silos your context:
- Claude.ai memory doesn't work in Claude Code
- Claude Code's CLAUDE.md files don't work in ChatGPT
- ChatGPT's memory doesn't work in Gemini
- None of them talk to each other

You repeat yourself constantly. Context gets lost. Continuity breaks every time you switch tools.

Hippocampus is the memory layer that sits behind all of them.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the open standard every major AI platform has adopted. Hippocampus is a remote MCP server that exposes memory tools. Any AI that supports MCP can connect.

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+
- **MCP SDK:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (official TypeScript SDK)
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP on `/mcp`
- **Framework:** Hono (lightweight, works with MCP middleware)
- **Database:** SQLite via `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` (encrypted with SQLCipher, AES-256)
- **Embeddings:** Local via `@huggingface/transformers` (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, q8, ~80MB, no API key needed)
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (MCP standard, self-contained for single user)

### Data Model

Knowledge graph: entities → observations → relationships.

```sql
-- Entities: people, projects, concepts, preferences
-- version_hash: SHA-256 of sorted observation content (cross-platform staleness detection)
entities (id, name, type, created_at, updated_at, version_hash, version_at)

-- Observations: facts about entities
-- kind: fact, decision, question, preference (or custom). Filterable.
-- importance: manual boost (0.0-2.0, 1.0 neutral) for always-relevant facts
-- recall tracking: last_recalled_at + recall_count for decay-weighted retrieval
observations (id, entity_id, content, source, kind, importance, created_at,
             last_recalled_at, recall_count)

-- Relationships: connections between entities
relationships (id, from_entity, to_entity, relation_type, created_at)

-- Embeddings: vector representations for semantic search
embeddings (id, entity_id, observation_id, vector, text_content, created_at)
```

Schema V6 (current). Entire database encrypted at rest with SQLCipher. Embeddings included — research shows original text can be reconstructed from embedding vectors.

### MCP Tools (11)

```
remember(content, entity?, type?, source?, importance?, kind?)
  → Store a fact. Dedup on write (cosine >= 0.85, same UTC day only, append-only
    entities exempt), near-match detection, subspace novelty scoring via SVD.
    Returns version_hash, and replaced: true if the write deleted anything.

recall(query, limit?, type?, since?, kind?, spread?, format?)
  → Semantic + keyword search. 4 formats (full/compact/wire/index).
    Spreading activation follows relationships 1 hop. Reconsolidation
    hints flag stale observations (never on append-only entities).
    Includes version_hash per entity.

forget(entity?, observation_id?)
  → Permanent deletion. PRAGMA secure_delete = ON — zeros freed pages.

update(entity, old_content, new_content)
  → Replace observation by exact content match. Returns version_hash.

merge(observation_ids, content)
  → Atomic consolidation. Replace N observations with one merged text.
    Returns version_hash.

merge_entities(source_entities, target_entity)
  → Structural consolidation. Moves all data, deletes sources.
    Returns version_hash.

context(topic, depth?)
  → Graph traversal. Entity + observations + relationships + related
    entities via BFS. Includes version_hash.

consolidate(entity?, threshold?, mode?, age_days?)
  → 4 modes: observations (dedup clusters), entities (name resolution),
    contradictions (conflicting claims), sleep (lifecycle analysis —
    compress/prune/refresh candidates).

export(format, entity?, type?)
  → 5 formats: claude-md, markdown, json, wire, obsidian.

check_version(entity, version_hash?)
  → "Did anything change?" Cached hash in, is_current boolean out.
    No embeddings, no content — pure metadata.

onboard(source?)
  → Bootstrap memory from a new AI session. Returns extraction
    instructions the AI follows. Lists existing entities to avoid dupes.
```

## Self-Hosting

### Recommended: Hetzner VPS (€4/month)

EU jurisdiction (GDPR), Helsinki or Stockholm datacenter, professional infrastructure. Database encrypted with SQLCipher — even if someone stole the raw disk, they get nothing without your passphrase.

### Other options
- **Fly.io** (~$5/mo) — easiest deploy, `fly launch` and done
- **Home server + Cloudflare Tunnel** — free, maximum hardware control
- **Railway / Render** — simple, good for getting started

See SECURITY.md for full comparison and detailed setup instructions.

## Revenue Model

**Open source. Free forever. Donations welcome.**

No hosted version. No SaaS. No customer support obligations. No liability for other people's data.

Stripe Payment Link in the README: "If Hippocampus is useful, buy me a coffee." One-time donations, not subscriptions.

## What Shipped

### 0.1.0 — Core
Core server, 6 tools (remember, recall, forget, update, context, export), SQLCipher encryption, local embeddings, OAuth 2.1, Docker + Caddy. Dedup on write, near-match detection, compact/wire/index recall formats, budgeted context resource, adaptive onboarding, contradiction detection, entity resolution, spreading activation.

### 0.2.0 — Memory Lifecycle
Subspace novelty scoring (SVD), sleep mode (compress/prune/refresh lifecycle analysis), reconsolidation hints on recall, observation kind and importance. The "overnight defrag" for knowledge graphs.

### 0.3.1 — Artifact Storage
Content limit raised from 2,000 to 50,000 chars. Enables storing writing frameworks, skill templates, CLAUDE.md files — anything you want available across AI tools. Semantic search still uses the embedding window (~1,500 chars); long artifacts are retrieved by entity name, keyword, or context tool.

### 0.3.0 — Cross-Platform Staleness
Entity versioning (SHA-256 hash per entity, recomputed on every mutation), `check_version` tool (cached hash in, is_current boolean out), `onboard` tool (guided first-session extraction), version_hash propagated through all tool responses. The "did anything change while I was in ChatGPT?" release.

## Differentiation

Nobody else is building this:
- **Claude.ai native memory** — Claude only. Doesn't work in Claude Code, ChatGPT, or anything else.
- **ChatGPT memory** — ChatGPT only. Siloed.
- **CLAUDE.md files** — Claude Code only. Local files on disk.
- **Mem0** — Local MCP server. Doesn't work across platforms.
- **Hippocampus** — One server, every AI platform, knowledge graph with semantic search, self-hosted and encrypted. Cross-platform staleness detection so AIs know when their cached context is stale without re-fetching everything.

## What Counts as Success (and when to park)

Open-source and free forever — so success is **not** a paying-user count. It's:
- **Coverage** — it works across the platforms it claims. The untested ones (ChatGPT Developer Mode, Gemini) are the live gaps that block the "universal memory" claim — see `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Daily-driver** — it's Karolina's own cross-platform memory layer, used in practice. Dogfood is the tell.
- **Others self-hosting** — a signal the universal-memory job is felt beyond n=1 (the donation link is a loose proxy, never a target).

**Park, not kill:** it's a working tool she relies on — you don't kill that. But *feature* work parks if adoption stays flat after a real launch push; the core stands regardless.

## What It Is NOT (the non-priorities)

The deliberate below-tablestakes — the choices that keep it focused, private, and self-hostable:
- **No hosted version / no SaaS.** Self-host only — no customer-data liability, no billing code, no support obligation (see Revenue Model).
- **No external API dependency.** Local embeddings only (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, in-process) — privacy + no key, at the deliberate cost of SOTA embedding quality.
- **Not per-platform memory.** One server, every platform — the opposite of Claude-only / ChatGPT-only native memory (see Differentiation).
- **Consolidate ≠ auto-merge.** Hippo *clusters* (embedding math); the AI *merges* (language). It never silently merges your memories.
- **No observation-level supersession.** Entity-versioning solves staleness without a soft-delete model (which conflicts with `secure_delete`) — see CLAUDE.md.

## Name

The hippocampus is the part of the brain that forms new memories, consolidates them, and maps relationships between concepts. It's how you navigate both physical space and conceptual space.

`hippocampus` as the repo. `hippo` as the CLI shorthand.
